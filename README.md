# Optimize.Bio
A Consensus Sequence Design Tool for Molecular Cloning Workflows and DNA Vaccine Design

Optimize.Bio is a sequence alignment and codon optimization tool designed to create multiple sequence alignments (MSA) for input amino acid sequences and generate a codon-optimized cDNA sequence for molecular cloning. The purpose of this program is to rapidly generate optimized sequences to synthetically design and produce proteins to clone into expression plasmids. An example use case would be optimization of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein sequence from different strains to generate a human-centered sequence for designing a DNA vaccine. Optimize.Bio is an easy-to-use desktop GUI supporting manual file inputs or file uploads and processing of between 3-10 amino acid sequences at a time. The MSA algorithm is derived from the [MUSCLE algorithm](https://biopython.org/docs/dev/api/Bio.Align.Applications.html) developed by Robert C. Edgar and included in the Biopython module (1). The codon optimization algorithm used here was developed by the Ediburgh Genome Foundry called [DNAChisel](https://github.com/Edinburgh-Genome-Foundry/DnaChisel), consisting of a massive library with different tools from which the DNA optimization and reverse translation tools were obtained (2). The consensus sequence design algorithm was developed by me, and is a relatively simple implementation relying on nucleotide frequencies within a given set of input sequences from the MSA.
